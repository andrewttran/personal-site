            Summer of 2018, I cofounded Vaultima and participated in the first

            learned so much through building tools such as W4TF (React.js) and

          <h2>I'm a Teacher</h2>
          <p>
            In my time at Harvard, I have been a teaching fellow for Harvard's
            introductory Computer Science (CS 50) and introductory Probability
            Theory (Stat 110) classes. For my work, I was awarded the Bok Center
            Distinction for Teaching. It's so fulfulling to be able to help my
            fellow students better learn and understand these concepts. Being
            someone's first introduction to certain concepts, I strive to foster
            a sense of understanding and enjoyment that will lead to further
            studies of these subjects. Both CS 50 and Stat 110 have materials
            online for anyone to learn. See the links below, and feel free to
            reach out if you need any help with the materials!

          <p>
            One of my biggest on-campus activities is helping run HackHarvard,
            an annual hackathon hosted at Harvard University. Every year, we
            have over 500 students from across the Northeast and the world come
            together to make awesome projects, often using technologies from our
            sponsor companies. As part of the Logistics team, I help ensure the
            event runs as smoothly as possible for all of our Hackers and
            Sponsors. If you or interested in learning more or sponsoring, feel

            Whether it's in the products I build, in the way I interact with

            respecting others. At the end of the day, we are all people, and we
            should all strive to make the world a better place for each other.
            That being said, we all make mistakes, and we should not be afraid
            to admit them and do our best to fix them.
